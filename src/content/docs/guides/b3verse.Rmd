## What is the b3verse?

The **b3verse** is a collection of related R packages that streamline indicator calculation from occurrence cubes. These packages are accessible and maintained via a [dedicated R-universe platform](https://b-cubed-eu.r-universe.dev/), ensuring continuous updates, easy distribution, and efficient [installation](#installation).

In addition to the R packages, the **b3verse** also includes a dedicated [data package](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15181097), **b3data**, published in the [Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io/) format. This package provides datasets that can be used directly with the **b3verse software**, including example occurrence cubes and spatial reference layers. For more information, visit the [b3data documentation](https://docs.b-cubed.eu/guides/b3data/).

## Getting started
### The b3verse workflow

Occurrence cubes can be derived from GBIF data using the **rgbif** package or simulated using the **gcube** package.
They are then processed using the `process_cube()` function from the **b3gbi** package.
This ensures standardised input data across all indicator packages and verifies that the data format is correct.
Data exploration steps can be performed using **dubicube**.
Once the data cubes are processed, indicators can be calculated with **b3gbi**, **pdindicatoR** or **impIndicator**.
The **dubicube** package enables uncertainty estimation via bootstrapping. It is not a strict dependency of the indicator calculation packages, as it can also be used with custom indicator functions.

### Example workflow

We provide a basic example of an analysis workflow using the **b3verse** packages.
This example demonstrates the process but is not intended as a best-practice analysis.
For more detailed guidance, refer to the package tutorials.  

In this workflow, we use **gcube** v1.1.2 to simulate an occurrence cube, **b3gbi** v0.4.2 to process the cube, and **dubicube** v0.4.0 to calculate uncertainty around indicator estimates.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(gcube)     # simulate occurrence cubes
library(b3gbi)     # process occurrence cubes
library(dubicube)  # uncertainty calculation for occurrence cubes

library(sf)        # work with spatial objects
library(dplyr)     # data wrangling
library(ggplot2)   # data visualisation
```

#### Simulate occurrence cube

As input, we create a polygon in which we simulate occurrences.
It represents the spatial extend of the species.
We also need a grid.
Each observation will be designated to a grid cell.

```{r species-range-grid, fig.height=4}
# Create polygon
polygon <- st_polygon(list(cbind(c(500, 1000, 1000, 600, 200, 100, 500),
                                 c(200, 100, 700, 1000, 900, 500, 200))))

# Create grid
cube_grid <- st_make_grid(
  st_buffer(polygon, 50),
  n = c(20, 20),
  square = TRUE) %>%
  st_sf()

# Visualise
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = polygon) +
  geom_sf(data = cube_grid, alpha = 0) +
  theme_minimal()
```

We simulate three species for 5 time points where each species has a different average total number of occurrences at time point one and a different spatial clustering (see also [this tutorial](https://b-cubed-eu.github.io/gcube/articles/multi-species-approach.html)).

```{r}
# Create dataframe with simulation function arguments
multi_species_args <- tibble(
  species = paste("species", 1:3, sep = "_"),
  species_key = 1:3,
  species_range = rep(list(polygon), 3),
  initial_average_occurrences = c(300, 400, 500),
  n_time_points = rep(5, 3),
  temporal_function = c(NA, simulate_random_walk, NA),
  sd_step = c(NA, 10, NA),
  spatial_pattern = c("random", "clustered", "clustered"),
  coords_uncertainty_meters = 25,
  grid = rep(list(cube_grid), 3),
  seed = 123
)

# How does this dataframe look like?
glimpse(multi_species_args)
```

We simulate the datacube with these arguments.

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height=4}
# Simulate occurrence cube
occurrence_cube_full <- multi_species_args %>%
  gcube::map_simulate_occurrences() %>%
  gcube::map_sample_observations() %>%
  gcube::map_filter_observations() %>%
  gcube::map_add_coordinate_uncertainty() %>%
  gcube::map_grid_designation(nested = FALSE)

# Select relevant columns
occurrence_cube_df <- occurrence_cube_full %>%
  select("cell_code", "time_point", "species", "species_key", "n",
         "min_coord_uncertainty")

# Visualise
glimpse(occurrence_cube_df)
```

#### Process occurrence cube

We process our simulated cube using the `process_cube()` function from the **b3gbi** package.
This ensures standarisation and verifies a correct data format.

```{r}
# Process cube
processed_cube <- b3gbi::process_cube(
  cube_name = occurrence_cube_df,
  grid_type = "custom",
  cols_cellCode = "cell_code",
  cols_year = "time_point",
  cols_species = "species",
  cols_speciesKey = "species_key",
  cols_occurrences = "n",
  cols_minCoordinateUncertaintyInMeters = "min_coord_uncertainty"
)

processed_cube
```

#### Indicator calculation

Finally, we calculate a simple indicator: the total number of observations per species per year.

```{r}
species_observations <- function(cube) {
  # Calculate the number of observations per species per year
  cube %>%
    summarise(diversity_val = sum(obs),
              .by = c(scientificName, year))
}
```

The values are calculated and added to a new column `diversity_val`.

```{r}
species_observations(processed_cube$data)
```

We use bootstrapping to calculate uncertainty around the estimates.
We calculate the 95 % Bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) interval for each estimate.

```{r}
# Perform bootstrapping
bootstrap_observations <- dubicube::bootstrap_cube(
  data_cube = processed_cube$data,
  fun = species_observations,
  grouping_var = c("scientificName", "year"),
  samples = 1000,
  seed = 123
)

# Calculate BCa intervals
ci_observations <- dubicube::calculate_bootstrap_ci(
  bootstrap_samples_df = bootstrap_observations,
  grouping_var = c("scientificName", "year"),
  type = "bca",
  conf = 0.95,
  data_cube = processed_cube$data,
  fun = species_observations
)

ci_observations
```

We visualise the results.

```{r indicator-trends}
ci_observations %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = est_original, colour = scientificName)) +
      geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ll, ymax = ul),
                    linewidth = 0.8, position = position_dodge(1)) +
      geom_point(size = 3, position = position_dodge(1)) +
      labs(y = "number of observations", x = "time point", colour = "species") +
      theme_minimal()
```
