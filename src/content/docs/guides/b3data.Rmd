This guide provides an overview of the **b3data** [frictionless](https://docs.ropensci.org/frictionless/) data package and supporting scripts, which serve as foundational resources for calculating biodiversity indicators from occurrence cubes within the [**b3verse**](https://docs.b-cubed.eu/guides/b3verse/).

## What is b3data?

The **b3data** data package is a curated and versioned collection of datasets, designed for use in the **b3verse** indicator calculation workflow. It is published in accordance with the [frictionless](https://docs.ropensci.org/frictionless/) data specifications, that allow publishing datasets in a [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and open manner.

The dataset is published on Zenodo and compiled using R code:

- **Compiled by**: [`b3data-scripts`](https://github.com/b-cubed-eu/b3data-scripts)
- **Used in**: [**b3verse**](https://docs.b-cubed.eu/guides/b3verse/)
- **Importable in R via**:
  [frictionless](https://docs.ropensci.org/frictionless/) R package
